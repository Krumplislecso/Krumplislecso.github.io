<h1>Clash of clans best bases and attack strategies <br> TH4-5-6</h1>
In this page we will walk through the most effective attack strategies and village layouts for each level mentioned. There are different types of bases for different purposes. The 2 basic types are farming bases and war bases.
<p>Farming bases</p>
Farming bases' goal is mostly to protect your resources from other players. This means you have to put your storages inside the base, providing maximum protection by walls and the defensive buildings. You don't necessarily need to put your town hall inside, indeed, it is better sometimes to put it outside your base so that the trophy hunter attackers can easily take it out, and give you a long time shield against other attackers, with losing only a little of your resources
<p>War bases</p>
In clan wars, you obviously want to make your enemy's job harder at taking down your base, and getting stars, so you have to make your base strong in every aspect to make it  undefeatable at your own level. This does not depend just on how strong cc troops do your clanmates give (which is important too, of course), but rather on the layout of your base. Another important thing is that you have to keep your town hall in the middle of the base, because destroying the town hall instantly gives 1 star out of 3 to the attacker.
<p>Attack strategies</p>
Attack strategies can also be grouped into these previous 2 types: farming and and war attack strategies. Farming armies are used for gaining loot at a low elixir cost. That means a farming army is usually cheaper than a war army. War armies are used for destroying bases enirely in cws, which can be difficult and you have to use the right army and strategy for the right base for success.
